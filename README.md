- Basic understanding of [Balancer v3](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/concepts/core-concepts/introduction.html)
- Some familiarity with Balancer's ["Build a custom AMM" documentation](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk)
- [Scaffold ETH 2](https://scaffold-eth-2-docs.vercel.app/)
- [Balancer v3 Monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo)

### üé• Demo

Watch this video to quickly get acquainted with the full stack dev environment üëá

- The [Pools](http://localhost:3000/pools) page will automatically add a button above the search bar for any pools deployed using the latest factory contract

## 0. Environment Setup üßë‚Äçüíª

### üìú Requirements

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

### ‚ö° Quickstart

#### 1.1 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer-v3.git
```

#### 1.2 Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

#### 1.3 Set environment variables

Set the necessary environment variables in a `packages/foundry/.env` file

```
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=...
```

- The `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` must start with `0x`
- The `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` facilitates running a local fork and sending transactions to sepolia testnet

#### 1.4 Start Local Fork

By default, this project runs on a local anvil fork of the Sepolia testnet

```bash
yarn fork
```

#### 1.5 Deploy Contracts

All contracts are deployed from the wallet associated to the `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` specified in the `.env`. By default, this wallet receives mock tokens and the resulting BPT from pool initialization

###### 1.5.1 Deploy pool factory, mock tokens, and hooks contract

```bash
yarn deploy:factory
```

###### 1.5.2 Deploy, register, and initialize pool #1

```bash
yarn deploy:pool1
```

###### 1.5.3 Deploy, register, and initialize pool #2

```bash
yarn deploy:pool2
```

#### 6. Start the Frontend

```bash
yarn start
```

üéâ Now you are ready to navigate to http://localhost:3000 and get started!

### üíÅ Scaffold ETH 2 Tips

SE-2 offers a variety of configuration options for connecting an account, choosing networks, and deploying contracts

<details><summary><strong>üî• Burner Wallet</strong></summary>

If you do not have an active wallet extension connected to your web browser, then scaffold eth will automatically connect to a "burner wallet" that is randomly generated on the frontend and saved to the browser's local storage. When using the burner wallet, transactions will be instantly signed, which is convenient for quick iterative development.

To force the use of burner wallet, disable your browsers wallet extensions and refresh the page. Note that the burner wallet comes with 0 ETH to pay for gas so you will need to click the faucet button in top right corner. Also the mock tokens for the pool are minted to your deployer account set in `.env` so you will want to navigate to the "Debug Contracts" page to mint your burner wallet some mock tokens to use with the pool.

![Burner Wallet](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/assets/73561520/0a1f3456-f22a-46b5-9e05-0ef5cd17cce7)

![Debug Tab Mint](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/assets/73561520/fbb53772-8f6d-454d-a153-0e7a2925ef9f)

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üëõ Browser Extension Wallet</strong></summary>

To use your preferred browser extension wallet, ensure that the account you are using matches the PK you previously provided in the `foundry/.env` file. As a convenience, the foundry deploy scripts max approve the vault contract to spend tokens.

‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to add a local development network with rpc url `http://127.0.0.1:8545/` and chain id `31337`. Also, you may need to reset the nonce data for your wallet exension if it gets out of sync.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üêõ Debug Contracts Page </strong></summary>

The [Debug Contracts Page](http://localhost:3000/debug) can be useful for viewing and interacting with all of the externally avaiable read and write functions of a contract. The page will automatically hot reload with contracts that are deployed via the `01_DeployConstantSumFactory.s.sol` script. We use this handy setup to mint `mockERC20` tokens to any connected wallet

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üö™ Changing The Frontend Network Connection</strong></summary>

The network the frontend points at is set via `targetNetworks` in the `scaffold.config.ts` file using `chains` from viem. By default, the frontend runs on a local node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

```typescript
const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üçΩÔ∏è Changing The Forked Network</strong></summary>

By default, the `yarn fork` command points at sepolia, but any of the network aliases from the `[rpc_endpoints]` of `foundry.toml` can be used to modify the `"fork"` alias in the `packages/foundry/package.json` file

```json
	"fork": "anvil --fork-url ${0:-sepolia} --chain-id 31337 --config-out localhost.json",
```

To point the frontend at a different forked network, change the `targetFork` in `scaffold.config.ts`

```typescript
const scaffoldConfig = {
  // The networks the frontend can connect to
  targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],

  // If using chains.foundry as your targetNetwork, you must specify a network to fork
  targetFork: chains.sepolia,
```

## 1. Design a Custom Pool üßë‚Äçüé®

Ultimately, this repo can be used to create custom pool factories, custom pools from said factory, and register and initialize them so the pools can be interacted with using this repo's front end, all in a local environment. Before jumping into all of that, it is key that developers understand the general make-up of a custom pool.

Therefore, this checkpoint focuses on writing the smart contract for a custom pool (without a factory). We will walk through the `ConstantSumPool.sol` found within `packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumPool.sol`.

---

### üëò 2.1 Write a Custom Pool Contract

As a refresher, make sure to check out the [docs on creating custom pools as well](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/concepts/guides/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html#build-your-custom-amm).

All custom pool contracts must inherit from `IBasePool` and `BalancerPoolToken` and implement the three required functions: `onSwap`, `computeInvariant`, and `computeBalance`.

Let's walk through each function in `ConstantSumPool.sol`

---

#### 2.1.1 `onSwap()` Implementation

Listed here for easy reference, the function discussed can also be found [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumPool.sol#L25C1-L26C1).

<details markdown='1'><summary>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Code for `onSwap` functions </summary>
Inside `ConstantSumPool.sol`

```
   /**
	 * @notice Execute a swap in the pool.
	 * @param params Swap parameters
	 * @return amountCalculatedScaled18 Calculated amount for the swap
	 */
	function onSwap(
		SwapParams calldata params
	) external pure returns (uint256 amountCalculatedScaled18) {
		amountCalculatedScaled18 = params.amountGivenScaled18;
	}

```

</details>

Looking at monorepo, one sees that `onSwap()` is ultimately called within a `swap()` call in the [`Vault.sol`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/9bc5618d7717dfbafd3cfbf025e7d3317ad7cacb/pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L327).

Essentially, the `onSwap()` call carries the custom pool logic that the vault queries to understand how much of the requested token the swap should return.

This step can vary between custom pool variations. To paint a contrast, a simple implementation can be seen within this `ConstantSumPool` example, where the amount swapped in is simply the amount swapped out (see toggle below).

Whereas you can begin to see the endless possibilities that exist when you take a look at the [WeightedPool implementation](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool.sol#L100-L126).

There you can see that the return value is dependent on the `SwapKind` and ultimately uses the `WeightedMath` functions to respect the invariant and other details for WeightedPools.

#### ü•Ö ** `onSwap()` Goals / Checks**

- [ ] ‚ùì Can you describe how `onSwap()` works within the Balancer V3 monorepo architecture and thus how custom pools must accomodate said architecture?

---

#### 2.1.2 `computeInvariant()` Implementation

Listed here for easy reference, the function discussed can also be found [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumPool.sol#L39).

<details markdown='1'><summary>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Code for `computeInvariant()` function </summary>
Inside `ConstantSumPool.sol`

```
  /**
	 * @notice Computes and returns the pool's invariant.
	 * @dev This function computes the invariant based on current balances
	 * @param balancesLiveScaled18 Array of current pool balances for each token in the pool, scaled to 18 decimals
	 * @return invariant The calculated invariant of the pool, represented as a uint256
	 */
	function computeInvariant(
		uint256[] memory balancesLiveScaled18
	) public pure returns (uint256 invariant) {
		invariant = balancesLiveScaled18[0] + balancesLiveScaled18[1];
	}

```

</details>

This function is called throughout a number of sequences within the BalancerV3 architecture. Let's walk through one at a high-level.

By simply searching within the v3 monorepo, we can see that it is used within the [`Vault.sol`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/fd288fef56cbb20284d34c9b2b1d4227285922dc/pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L864) and other contracts relying on `BasePoolMath.sol`. Functions like [`computeRemoveLiquiditySingleTokenExactOut()`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/fd288fef56cbb20284d34c9b2b1d4227285922dc/pkg/solidity-utils/contracts/math/BasePoolMath.sol#L261) are inside `BasePoolMath.sol`. They call `computeInvariant()` to calculate the bptAmounts to be used within a respective transaction as well as the fees involved. Other primary contracts that rely on this function are: `VaultExtension.sol`, where it is used to calculate the bpt amounts involved when initializing a new pool.

Essentially, the invariant is used at different points of the transaction to ensure its mathematical logic is upheld within the respective pool. These of course can vary vastly based on the design that is taken. The most well-known invariant is the constant product invariant, as discussed within the BalancerV3 docs [here](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html#build-your-custom-amm:~:text=%23-,Compute%20Invariant,-Custom%20AMMs%20built) briefly.

For this example, the invariant is simply a constant sum invariant.

#### ü•Ö ** `computeInvariant()` Goals / Checks**

- [ ] ‚ùì Can you describe how `computeInvariant()` works within the Balancer V3 monorepo architecture with the `Vault.sol`, `BasePoolMath.sol`, `VaultExtension.sol` and thus how custom pools must accomodate said architecture?

---

#### 2.1.3 `computeBalance()` Implementation

Listed here for easy reference, the function discussed can also be found [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumPool.sol#L55).

<details markdown='1'><summary>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Code for `computeBalance()` function </summary>
Inside `ConstantSumPool.sol`

```
  /**
	 * @dev Computes the new balance of a token after an operation, given the invariant growth ratio and all other
	 * balances.
	 * @param balancesLiveScaled18 Current live balances (adjusted for decimals, rates, etc.)
	 * @param tokenInIndex The index of the token we're computing the balance for, in token registration order
	 * @param invariantRatio The ratio of the new invariant (after an operation) to the old
	 * @return newBalance The new balance of the selected token, after the operation
	 */
	function computeBalance(
		uint256[] memory balancesLiveScaled18,
		uint256 tokenInIndex,
		uint256 invariantRatio
	) external pure returns (uint256 newBalance) {
		uint256 invariant = computeInvariant(balancesLiveScaled18);

		newBalance =
			(balancesLiveScaled18[tokenInIndex] +
				invariant *
				(invariantRatio)) -
			invariant;
	}

```

</details>

Looking at monorepo, one sees that `computeBalance()` is ultimately called to return the new balance of a token after an operation, given the invariant growth ratio and all other balances.
In this case, it is constant sum invariant that we simply need to create.

The docs outline how `computeBalance()` is used to return the needed balance of a pool token for a specific invariant change. So basically it is used to calculate an amount of a pool token when the resultant invariant is known. This can be seen in function calls within the v3 monorepo where expected balances are used to calculate the invariant ratio for liquidity operations such as that seen in functions [`_addLiquidity()`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L630C1-L638C19) and [`_removeLiquidity()_`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L850C13-L858C19).

To elaborate on things a bit further, within `Vault.sol`, two main internal functions use `computeBalance()`. These are: `_addLiquidity()` which calls upon , and `_removeLiquidity()` which calls upon `computeAddLiquiditySingleTokenExactOut()`, and `computeRemoveLiquiditySingleTokenExactIn()`, respectively. Within both of these sequences, the `computeBalance()` return value is used in calculating the eventual amount to debit (tokens marked as debt for the user as seen in `_takeDebt()` in the `VaultCommon.sol`) or credit (tokens marked as credit for the user as seen in `supplyCredit()` in the `VaultCommon.sol`) for the respective function call.

For the simple constant price pool example, we have a standard calculation of newBalance using the invariantRatio and current invariant.

#### ü•Ö ** `computeBalance()` Goals / Checks**

- [ ] ‚ùì Can you describe how `computeBalance()` works within the Balancer V3 monorepo architecture and thus how custom pools must accomodate said architecture?

> üí° Nice! We've now walked through a basic custom pool construction, let's get into how the custom pool factory contracts work.

---

## 2. Design a Pool Factory üé®

Now that you have created a custom pool, it is time to deploy the associated custom pool factory. As outlined within the [docs](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html#deploy-your-pool:~:text=Creating%20pools%20via,%23), Balancer's off-chain infrastructure uses the `factory` address to ID the `type` of pool. For this repo, we've created a custom pool factory example and associated script to deploy it, and create a new pool using said factory.

In addition to being useful for integrating into Balancer, once the custom pool factory is deployed, anyone can come along and deploy more of that specific custom pool type, with varying pool parameters.

The example factory continues off of the previous section and uses `ConstantSumPool.sol` as the Custom Pool type. Within the script the first pool from said factory is deployed, registered, and initialized, so you can interact with it right away. Another script is created so you can create more pools and enter in the param details via your favorite code editor too.

This section will walk you through:

- Creating and
  the custom pool factory example.
- Running the script to deploy more pools from said custom pool factory.

---

### Creating the Custom Pool Factory

We will focus on creating the `ConstantSumFactory.sol` contract. Let's focus on the constructor first.

Listed here for easy reference, the constructor discussed can also be found [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumFactory.sol#L22).

<details markdown='1'><summary>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Code for `constructor()` </summary>
Inside `ConstantSumFactory.sol`

```
constructor(
        IVault vault,
        uint256 pauseWindowDuration
    ) BasePoolFactory(vault, pauseWindowDuration, type(ConstantSumPool).creationCode) {
        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks
    }
```

</details>

It is used to deploy the `ConstantSumPool.sol` example custom pool we walked through earlier. It inherits the `BasePoolFactory.sol` from BalancerV3's monorepo.

For a factory associated to the `ConstantSumPool.sol` we do not need any extra implementation within the constructor. Thus, all we need to do is write the constructor with the appropriate params as described below for `BasePoolFactory.sol`.

1. `IVault vault` - The BalancerV3 vault on the respective network.
2. `uint256 pauseWindowDuration` - The pause window that will be used for all pools created from this factory. It is the timeframe that a newly created pool can be paused before its buffer endtime. Once a pool is paused, it will remain paused til the end of the pause window, and subsequently will wait til the vault's buffer period ends. When the buffer period expires, it will unpause automatically, and remain permissionless forever after.
3. `bytes memory creationCode` - The creation code that is used within the `_create()` internal function call when creating new pools. This is associated to the respective custom pool that you are looking to create.

> NOTE: more implementation can be input for the constructor for your own custom pool of course, but for this example we are keeping things simple. Even pools such as [WeightedPools](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/9bc5618d7717dfbafd3cfbf025e7d3317ad7cacb/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool8020Factory.sol#L21) and [StablePools](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-stable/contracts/StablePoolFactory.sol) can have simple constructor setups as seen in the v3 monorepo.

Moving on to the next part, the `create()` function is used to create new pools from the custom pool factory, adhering to the specific type of pools for said factory. In this case, that's the `ConstantSumPool`.

---

### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª 3.1.1 `create()` Function

The `create()` function, in this simple example pool factory, simply calls the `_create()` function within the `BasePoolFactory.sol`. The `_create()` function uses `CREATE3`, similar to `CREATE2` to deploy a pool that has a pre-determined address based on its salt, and encoded creation code & args.

Listed here for easy reference, the the `create()` function discussed can also be found [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumFactory.sol#L42).

<details markdown='1'><summary>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Code for `create()` function </summary>
Inside `ConstantSumFactory.sol`

     */
    function create(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        TokenConfig[] memory tokens,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external returns (address pool) {
        pool = _create(abi.encode(getVault(), name, symbol), salt);

        // Call registerPool from the vault. See `IVaultExtension.sol` for details on `registerPool()`
        getVault().registerPool(
            pool,
            tokens,
            getNewPoolPauseWindowEndTime(),
            address(0), // no pause manager
            PoolHooks({
                shouldCallBeforeInitialize: false,
                shouldCallAfterInitialize: false,
                shouldCallBeforeAddLiquidity: false,
                shouldCallAfterAddLiquidity: false,
                shouldCallBeforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
                shouldCallAfterRemoveLiquidity: false,
                shouldCallBeforeSwap: false,
                shouldCallAfterSwap: false
            }),
            LiquidityManagement({
                supportsAddLiquidityCustom: false,
                supportsRemoveLiquidityCustom: false
            })
        );

        _registerPoolWithFactory(pool); // register pool with respective factory (example facotry that was created in a previous tx, if using this repo it would've likely been from `DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol` script being ran).
    }
```

</details>

Here is the `_create()` internal function for reference (it can also be found [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/vault/contracts/factories/BasePoolFactory.sol#L86)):

```
function _create(bytes memory constructorArgs, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address) {
        return CREATE3.deploy(salt, abi.encodePacked(_creationCode, constructorArgs), 0);
    }
```

</details>

Within the function `create()` we call `_create()` with appropriate params, which will be touched on later within our scripts. For now, we move onto the next aspect of the `create()` call, which is to `registerPool()` with the BalancerV3 vault.

---

#### 3.1.1.1 Calling `registerPool()`

New pools need to be registered to the BalancerV3 vault to operate within the BalancerV3 architecture. The details of this function are outlined well within the [`IVaultExtension.sol` natspec](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/9bc5618d7717dfbafd3cfbf025e7d3317ad7cacb/pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IVaultExtension.sol#L53).

For the example factory contract we are working with, we have no pause manager, no hooks, and do not support "custom" liquidity provision or removal.

Finally, the `create()` function ends by calling `_registerPoolWithFactory(newPool)` (as seen [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/contracts/ConstantSumFactory.sol#L72)) which registers the new pool with the respective factory. This is done for accounting purposes, amongst other reasons.

> NOTE: like all other contracts and scripts within this repo, one must adjust aspects within this smart contract when creating their own type of custom pool.

## 3. Deploy a Pool Factory üè≠

Now that we have created the `ConstantSumFactory.sol` contract, it is time to write the deployment scripts. We've provided example deployment scripts to reference as you create your own, and will walk through key gotcha's when writing your own deployment scripts. As always, test on your own before deploying!

`DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol` is the file that we will use as a template, it can be found [here](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/script/DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol).

For sake of simplicity, we will outline the core function of the script, and then explain specific gotchas with the script. The main one being the params involved with initialization.

---

### üí™üèº 3.2.1 Core Script Function

The script, using the `.env` specified deployer wallet, deploys the custom pool factory example we've just discussed. From there, it creates a new pool with it, registers the new pool with the BalancerV3 Vault on the respective network (default anvil fork of Sepolia), and initializes it. It does all of this so it is ready to use with the ScaffoldBalancer front end tool. The variables defined when calling Balancer functions, like `Router.intiialize()` are specific to the constant price custom pool setup, whereas if you are working with a more complicated pool setup you may want to adjust these params as necessary.

---

### üí° 3.2.2 Key Gotchas

- Specific to this repo, the script `DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol` inherits [`ScaffoldETHDeploy.s.sol`](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/script/ScaffoldETHDeploy.s.sol) and [`HelperConfig`](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/utils/HelperConfig.sol)
- If using this and the associated deployment scripts to help troubleshoot your own custom pool type, then it is advised to use the `HelperConfig.sol` located at: `packages/foundry/utils/HelperConfig.sol`, to outline the appropriate details of your custom pool to use the already written example scripts within this repo.
- Balancer integration with `initialize()` has a couple of arrays that must match in terms of token ERC20 we are using, and the amounts of said token.

> It is key to understand that the script is calling [`Router.initialize()`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IRouter.sol#L39C5-L56C55) ultimately, and so understanding this function call and its params is crucial. See the BalancerV3 monorepo for more info. We touch on some of these params below, but the nat spec is also a great resource.

- Some variables have comments on them to assist, such as the custom pool factory
- This script uses MockToken contracts to instantly mint 1000 of each test token to deployer wallet.
- The TokenConfig struct is defined within [`VaultTypes.sol`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/VaultTypes.sol#L128) in the v3 monorepo. It has a few gotchas:
  - `TokenConfig.tokenType` is an enum: `STANDARD` OR `WITH_RATE`
  - `TokenConfig.token` is the token address
  - `TokenConfig.rateProvider` is the rate provider for the respective token. Rate Providers are not needed for `STANDARD` tokenTypes. These also are not yield bearing.
  - `TokenConfig.payYieldFees` is a flag marking whether yield fees are charged on this token. As per BalancerV2, all yield bearing tokens had to have a yieldFee.
- Salt is typically the name of the respective pool. This way deployment of said pool can be the same across other networks too as per typical use of `CREATE2` and `CREATE3`.
- `exactAmountsIn[]` are subject to the details of TokenConfig, specifically the `tokenType` and `rateProvider`
- `userData` is for additional (optional) data required for adding initial liquidity.
- Sender must approve transferrance/handling of its tokens with the router and vault
- New pool must approve transferrance/handling of these specific tokens via router and vault.
- New Custom Pool Factory address is console logged to be used with `DeployCustomPoolFromFactoryExample.s.sol`
- As per the high-level BalancerV3 architecture, the `Router` is the main integration entrypoint to the Balancer system. Thus, `Router.initialize()` is called to subsequently call the vault to initialize a new pool within the system.

Cool, now we have these gotcha's understood with the script. We can move on to simulating and deploying!

### ü§ñ 3.2.3: Interacting with the Custom Pool Factory via Scripts

As seen in the beginning of this [README](#024-deploy-contracts), this repo comes with bash commands to deploy the discussed smart contracts on a local anvil fork of the Sepolia test network. For quick reference, here are the commands again:

> If you would like to change the network the local node is forking, [review this section.](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#%F0%9F%9A%A8%F0%9F%9A%A8-checkpoint-4-%F0%9F%A7%AA-writing-typical-unit-and-fuzz-tests-for-custom-pool-example:~:text=0.3.4%20Changing%20The%20Frontend%20Network%20Connection)

To simulate deployment transactions on your local fork

```bash
forge script script/DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol --rpc-url localhost
```

To send the deployment transaction to your local fork:

```bash
yarn deploy:all
```

To simulate deployment transactions on sepolia testnet:

```bash
forge script script/DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia
```

To send the deployment transactions to sepolia testnet:

```bash
 yarn deploy:all ‚Äînetwork sepolia
```

\*To simulate or deploy to a different network, swap out `sepolia` for any of the `[rpc_endpoints]` aliases listed in `foundry.toml`

> Of course, as stated numerous times in this repo, deployments and use of real in production smart contracts are the developer's responsibility and not the creators of this repo. Developers must use their own due diligence in creating extra tests, getting external audits, bug bounties, working with teams, etc.

---

## 4. Deploy a Custom Pool üåä

Now that the pool factory has been deployed to the local fork, we have the option to deploy just a new pool by calling the `create()` function on the previously deployed pool. Notice that the [`DeployPool.s.sol`](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/script/DeployPool.s.sol) script also registers and initializes the pool.

> NOTE: that the pool name will have to be different than that of the initial pool made within the `DeployFactoryAndPool.s.sol` commands.

To simulate the pool deployment on your local fork:

```bash
forge script script/DeployPool.s.sol --rpc-url localhost
```

To send the pool deployment transaction to your local fork:

```bash
yarn deploy:pool
```

At this point, the factory has been deployed, and you have deployed at least one more pool from the factory using the scripts within this repo. Again, if you want to specify a different network, reference the instructions outlined before.

---

## 5. Contract Testing üß™

At this point we've gone through how to make a simple custom pool and custom pool factory, and to simulate and/or deploy them on a testnet. Testing is of course needed, amongst many other security measures such as audits, for a custom pool implementation.

We will now walk through the testing contracts, provided as foundry test files. They are written for the Constant Price Custom Pool we use throughout this repo as an example.

> üß† These test files roughly mirror the typical testing cases that are found in the BalancerV3 monorepo for weighted pool factory tests. As a reference tool, it only makes sense to have tests that, at the very least, roughly mirror how weighted pool factories are tested within BalancerV3 monorepo.

> If you are unfamiliar with writing tests with foundry please check out their docs [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Within the test files with this repo, we use fuzz testing, that the BalancerV3 monorepo also uses. Foundry docs on fuzz testing can be found [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/fuzz-testing).

To start, make sure you make your way to the proper path: `packages/foundry`. Run the following command to run the tests with this repo "off-the-shelf."

```
forge test
```

You should see the following test results in your terminal window.

![alt text](image.png)

These testing files can be used as a testing template, similar to how the smart contracts and scripts so far could be used as references or templates for your own custom pool implementation.

The tests that you see running are found in the following subdirectory / path: `packages/foundry/test`. There you will find test files, and template test files. The template files are simply copies of the test files but with comments outlining the details of each test, and marking variables to change out if you are using them as a starting template for your own tests.

> üö®üö® These files are not production ready, and it is the developer's responsibility to carry out proper testing and auditing for their pool.

### üé® 4.1 [`CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol`](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/test/CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol)

#### 4.1.1 Inherited Context for `CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol` ([`BaseVaultTest.sol`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/vault/test/foundry/utils/BaseVaultTest.sol#L4) & [`BaseTest.sol`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/c009aa9217070e88ed3a39bda97d83c14342f39b/pkg/solidity-utils/test/foundry/utils/BaseTest.sol#L4))

The v3 monorepo has pool tests inheriting a base setup implemented within `BaseVaultTest.sol` & `BaseTest.sol`.

`BaseTest.sol` (Inherited by `BaseVaultTest.sol`)

- Creates test ERC20s (DAI, USDC, WETH, wstETH), test users (`admin`, `lp`, `alice`, `bob`, `hacker`, `broke`)
- Users created are dealt 1 million of each test ERC20
- Each test ERC20 has 18 decimals (compared to actual implementations such as USDC with 6 decimals)

`BaseVaultTest.sol`:

- Creates core architecture in a test environment: vault, vaultExtension, router, authorizer, pool, rateProvider
- Creates a mock pool with the vault
- Initializes pool with user `lp`

---

#### 4.1.2 Walking Through the `CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol`

Now that we understand the base `BaseVaultTest.setUp()` call made within the `CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol`, we can get into the actual template files.

Each test has comments added to them to help guide the developer with this starter test template. There are "TODO" comments added on several lines to assist users in creating their own custom pool tests for their own custom pool types they are working on. Of course, one has to update dependencies and other aspects as needed for their purposes.

---

### üñº 4.2 [`CustomPoolFactoryTemplate.t.sol`](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/blob/1bb9e662e1f94bba7f30b7ad2a50bcee17ad9232/packages/foundry/test/CustomPoolFactoryTemplate.t.sol)

Unlike the `CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol`, the `CustomPoolFactoryTemplate.t.sol` has a simpler setup where a mock vault, a custom pool factory (specific to the one that is being tested), and two test tokens are deployed.

Similar to the `CustomPoolTemplate.t.sol` file, the `CustomPoolFactoryTemplate.t.sol` file has "TODOs" to guide users in creating their own appropriate tests once they have a custom pool factory type of their own that they need to test.
