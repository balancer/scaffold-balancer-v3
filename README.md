## üßë‚Äçüíª Environment Setup

### Requirements

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (>= v0.2.0)

### Quickstart

1. Ensure you have the latest version of foundry installed

```
foundryup
```

2. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer-v3.git
cd scaffold-balancer-v3
yarn install
```

3. In a `packages/foundry/.env` file, provide an RPC URL for Ethereum Mainnet

```
MAINNET_RPC_URL=
```

4. Start a local anvil fork of Ethereum mainnet

```bash
yarn fork
```

> By default, this project is setup to fork Ethereum mainnet. However, you can fork another network by following these steps:
>
> 1. Change `targetFork` in `scaffold.config.ts` to `chains.gnosis`
> 2. Modify `PoolHelpers.sol` to use the correct contract addresses
> 3. Run `yarn fork --network gnosis`

5. Deploy the mock tokens, pool factories, pool hooks, and custom pools contracts

```bash
yarn deploy
```

> By default, the anvil account #0 will be the deployer and recieve the mock tokens and BPT from pool initialization

6. Start the nextjs frontend

```bash
yarn start
```

7. Explore the frontend

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the home page
- Visit the [Pools Page](http://localhost:3000/pools) to search by address or select using the pool buttons
- Visit the [Hooks Page](http://localhost:3000/hooks) to see a growing library of pool hook examples
- Vist the [Debug Page](http://localhost:3000/debug) to see external read and write functions for each contract

8. Run the Foundry tests

```
yarn test
```

### Scaffold ETH 2 Tips

SE-2 offers a variety of configuration options for connecting an account, choosing networks, and deploying contracts

<details><summary><strong>üî• Burner Wallet</strong></summary>

If you do not have an active wallet extension connected to your web browser, then scaffold eth will automatically connect to a "burner wallet" that is randomly generated on the frontend and saved to the browser's local storage. When using the burner wallet, transactions will be instantly signed, which is convenient for quick iterative development.

To force the use of burner wallet, disable your browsers wallet extensions and refresh the page. Note that the burner wallet comes with 0 ETH to pay for gas so you will need to click the faucet button in top right corner. Also the mock tokens for the pool are minted to your deployer account set in `.env` so you will want to navigate to the "Debug Contracts" page to mint your burner wallet some mock tokens to use with the pool.

![Burner Wallet](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/assets/73561520/0a1f3456-f22a-46b5-9e05-0ef5cd17cce7)

![Debug Tab Mint](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/assets/73561520/fbb53772-8f6d-454d-a153-0e7a2925ef9f)

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üëõ Browser Extension Wallet</strong></summary>
    
- To use your preferred browser extension wallet, ensure that the account you are using matches the PK you previously provided in the `foundry/.env` file
- You may need to add a local development network with rpc url `http://127.0.0.1:8545/` and chain id `31337`. Also, you may need to reset the nonce data for your wallet exension if it gets out of sync.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üêõ Debug Contracts Page </strong></summary>

The [Debug Contracts Page](http://localhost:3000/debug) can be useful for viewing and interacting with all of the externally avaiable read and write functions of a contract. The page will automatically hot reload with contracts that are deployed via the `01_DeployConstantSumFactory.s.sol` script. We use this handy setup to mint `mockERC20` tokens to any connected wallet

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üåê Changing The Frontend Network Connection</strong></summary>

- The network the frontend points at is set via `targetNetworks` in the `scaffold.config.ts` file using `chains` from viem.
- By default, the frontend runs on a local node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

```typescript
const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üç¥ Changing The Forked Network</strong></summary>

- By default, the `yarn fork` command points at sepolia, but any of the network aliases from the `[rpc_endpoints]` of `foundry.toml` can be used to modify the `"fork"` alias in the `packages/foundry/package.json` file

```json
	"fork": "anvil --fork-url ${0:-sepolia} --chain-id 31337 --config-out localhost.json",
```

- To point the frontend at a different forked network, change the `targetFork` in `scaffold.config.ts`

```typescript
const scaffoldConfig = {
  // The networks the frontend can connect to
  targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],

  // If using chains.foundry as your targetNetwork, you must specify a network to fork
  targetFork: chains.sepolia,
```

## üïµÔ∏è Explore the Examples

Each of the following examples have turn key deploy scripts that can be found in the [foundry/script/](https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer-v3/tree/main/packages/foundry/script) directory

### Constant Sum Pool with Dynamic Swap Fee Hook

The swap fee percentage is altered by the hook contract before the pool calculates the amount for the swap

![dynamic-fee-hook](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ba69ea3-6894-4eeb-befa-ed87cfeb6b13)

### Constant Product Pool with Lottery Hook

An after swap hook that uses a random number to determine if user should pay into the lottery or receive the prize

![after-swap-hook](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/594ce1ac-2edc-4d16-9631-14feb2d085f8)

### Weighted Pool with Exit Fee Hook

An after remove liquidity hook adjusts the amounts before the vault transfers tokens to the user

## üåä Create a Custom Pool

Custom AMMs built on Balancer inherit the security of the Balancer vault, and benefit from a streamlined development process.

### Learn the Basics

- [Read the docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/build/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html)
- [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXynS3jAu0M)

### Recall the Key Requirements

- Must inherit from `IBasePool` and `BalancerPoolToken`
- Must implement `onSwap`, `computeInvariant`, and `computeBalance`
- Must implement `getMaximumSwapFeePercentage` and `getMinimumSwapFeePercentage`

## üè≠ Create a Pool Factory

While not mandatory, we do recommend using a factory contract for the deployment and registration of custom pools.

### Learn the Basics

- [Read the docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/build/build-an-amm/deploy-custom-amm-using-factory.html)
- [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXynS3jAu0M)

### Recall the Key Requirements

- A pool factory contract must inherit from [BasePoolFactory](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/contracts/factories/BasePoolFactory.sol)
- Use the internal `_create` function to deploy a new pool
- Use the internal `_registerPoolWithVault` fuction to register a pool immediately after creation

## ü™ù Create a Pool Hook

Hooks introduce a new framework for extending the functionality of existing pool types at key points throughout pool operation lifecycles.

### Learn the Basics

- [Read the docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/build/build-a-hook/extend-existing-pool-type.html)
- [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaz6duliRPA)

### Recall the Key Requirements

- A hooks contract must inherit from [BasePoolHooks.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/contracts/BaseHooks.sol)
- A hooks contract should also inherit from [VaultGuard.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/contracts/VaultGuard.sol)
- Must implement `onRegister` to determine if a pool is allowed to use the hook contract
- Must implement `getHookFlags` to define which hooks are supported
- The `onlyVault` modifier should be applied to all hooks functions (i.e. `onRegister`, `onBeforeSwap`, `onAfterSwap` ect.)

## üö¢ Deploy the Contracts

The deploy scripts are located in the [foundry/script/](https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer-v3/tree/main/packages/foundry/script) directory. To better understand the lifecycle of deploying a pool that uses a hooks contract, see the diagram below

![pool-deploy-scripts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb906080-8f42-46c0-af90-ba01ba1754fc)

### Understand Scaffold

For all the scaffold integrations to work properly, each deploy script must be imported into `Deploy.s.sol` and inherited by the `DeployScript` contract in `Deploy.s.sol`

### Broadcast Transactions

Run the following command to deploy the contracts to a local anvil fork

```bash
yarn deploy
```

Add a `--network` flag to deploy the contracts to a live network

```bash
yarn deploy --network sepolia
```

## üß™ Test the Contracts

The [balancer-v3-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo) provides testing utility contracts like [BasePoolTest](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/test/foundry/utils/BasePoolTest.sol) and [BaseVaultTest](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/test/foundry/utils/BaseVaultTest.sol). Therefore, the best way to begin writing tests for custom factories, pools, and hooks contracts is to leverage the examples established by the source code.

### Factories

The example `ConstantSumFactoryTest` mirrors the [WeightedPool8020FactoryTest
](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-weighted/test/foundry/WeightedPool8020Factory.t.sol)

```
yarn test --match-contract ConstantSumFactoryTest
```

### Pools

The example `ConstantSumPoolTest` mirrors the [WeightedPoolTest](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-weighted/test/foundry/WeightedPool.t.sol)

```
yarn test --match-contract ConstantSumPoolTest
```

### Hooks

The example `VeBALFeeDiscountHookExampleTest` mirrors the [VeBALFeeDiscountHookExampleTest](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-hooks/test/foundry/VeBALFeeDiscountHookExample.t.sol)

```
yarn test --match-contract VeBALFeeDiscountHookExampleTest
```
