### üé• Getting Started Demo

Watch this video to quickly get acquainted with the full stack dev environment üëá

## 0 Environment Setup üßë‚Äçüíª

### üìú 0.1 Requirements

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

### üèÉ 0.2 Quickstart

#### 0.2.1 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer-v3.git
```

#### 0.2.2 Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

#### 0.2.3 Set environment variables

Set the necessary environment variables in a `packages/foundry/.env` file

```
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=...
```

- The `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` must start with `0x`
- The `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` facilitates running a local fork and sending transactions to sepolia testnet

#### 0.2.4 Start a Local Fork

By default, this project runs on a local anvil fork of the Sepolia testnet

```bash
yarn fork
```

#### 0.2.5 Deploy Contracts

All contracts are deployed from the wallet associated to the `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` specified in the `.env`. By default, this wallet receives mock tokens and the resulting BPT from pool initialization

Deploy the pool factory, mock tokens, and hooks contracts

```bash
yarn deploy:factory
```

Deploy, register, and initialize pool #1

```bash
yarn deploy:pool1
```

Deploy, register, and initialize pool #2

```bash
yarn deploy:pool2
```

#### 0.2.6 Start the Frontend

```bash
yarn start
```

#### 0.2.7 Explore the Frontend

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the home page
- Visit the [Pools Page](http://localhost:3000/pools) to search by address or select using the buttons
- Vist the [Debug Page](http://localhost:3000/debug) to see the mock tokens, factory, and hooks contracts

### üíÅ 0.3 Scaffold ETH 2 Tips

SE-2 offers a variety of configuration options for connecting an account, choosing networks, and deploying contracts

<details><summary><strong>üî• Burner Wallet</strong></summary>

If you do not have an active wallet extension connected to your web browser, then scaffold eth will automatically connect to a "burner wallet" that is randomly generated on the frontend and saved to the browser's local storage. When using the burner wallet, transactions will be instantly signed, which is convenient for quick iterative development.

To force the use of burner wallet, disable your browsers wallet extensions and refresh the page. Note that the burner wallet comes with 0 ETH to pay for gas so you will need to click the faucet button in top right corner. Also the mock tokens for the pool are minted to your deployer account set in `.env` so you will want to navigate to the "Debug Contracts" page to mint your burner wallet some mock tokens to use with the pool.

![Burner Wallet](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/assets/73561520/0a1f3456-f22a-46b5-9e05-0ef5cd17cce7)

![Debug Tab Mint](https://github.com/Dev-Rel-as-a-Service/scaffold-balancer-v3/assets/73561520/fbb53772-8f6d-454d-a153-0e7a2925ef9f)

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üëõ Browser Extension Wallet</strong></summary>
To use your preferred browser extension wallet, ensure that the account you are using matches the PK you previously provided in the `foundry/.env` file. As a convenience, the foundry deploy scripts max approve the vault contract to spend tokens.

‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to add a local development network with rpc url `http://127.0.0.1:8545/` and chain id `31337`. Also, you may need to reset the nonce data for your wallet exension if it gets out of sync.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üêõ Debug Contracts Page </strong></summary>

The [Debug Contracts Page](http://localhost:3000/debug) can be useful for viewing and interacting with all of the externally avaiable read and write functions of a contract. The page will automatically hot reload with contracts that are deployed via the `01_DeployConstantSumFactory.s.sol` script. We use this handy setup to mint `mockERC20` tokens to any connected wallet

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üö™ Changing The Frontend Network Connection</strong></summary>

The network the frontend points at is set via `targetNetworks` in the `scaffold.config.ts` file using `chains` from viem. By default, the frontend runs on a local node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

```typescript
const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],
```

</details>

<details><summary><strong>üçΩÔ∏è Changing The Forked Network</strong></summary>

By default, the `yarn fork` command points at sepolia, but any of the network aliases from the `[rpc_endpoints]` of `foundry.toml` can be used to modify the `"fork"` alias in the `packages/foundry/package.json` file

```json
	"fork": "anvil --fork-url ${0:-sepolia} --chain-id 31337 --config-out localhost.json",
```

To point the frontend at a different forked network, change the `targetFork` in `scaffold.config.ts`

```typescript
const scaffoldConfig = {
  // The networks the frontend can connect to
  targetNetworks: [chains.foundry],

  // If using chains.foundry as your targetNetwork, you must specify a network to fork
  targetFork: chains.sepolia,
```

## 1 Create a Custom Pool üåä

### üìñ 1.1 Review the Docs

- [Create a custom AMM with a novel invariant](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html)

### üîë 1.2 Recall the Key Requirements

- Custom pools must inherit from `IBasePool` and `BalancerPoolToken`
- Custom pools must implement the three required functions: `onSwap`, `computeInvariant`, and `computeBalance`

### üìù 1.3 Write a Custom Pool Contract

To get started, try editing the`ConstantSumPool.sol` contract directly or make a copy

## 2 Create a Pool Factory üè≠

The recommended approach for deploying pools is via a factory contract because Balancer's off-chain infrastructure uses the factory address as a means to identify the type of pool, which is important for integration into the UI, SDK, and external aggregators

### üìñ 2.1 Review the Docs

- Coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

### üîë 2.2 Recall the Key Requirements

- A pool factory contract must inherit from [BasePoolFactory.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/contracts/factories/BasePoolFactory.sol)
- Use the internal `_create` function from `BasePoolFactory` to deploy a new pool
- Use the internal `_registerPoolWithVault` fuction from `BasePoolFactory` to register a pool immediately after creation

### üìù 2.3 Write a Factory Contract

To get started, try editing the`ConstantSumFactory.sol` contract directly or make a copy

## 3 Create a Pool Hook ü™ù

### üìñ 3.1 Review the Docs

- [Extend an Existing Pool Type Using Hooks](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/extend-existing-pool-type-using-hooks.html)

### üîë 3.2 Recall the Key Requirements

- A hook contract must inherit from [BasePoolHooks.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/vault/contracts/BaseHooks.sol)
- The virtual function `getHookFlags` must be implemented to define which hooks your contract supports
- The virtual function `onRegister` must be implemented to determine if a pool is allowed to use the hook contract

### üìù 3.3 Write a Hook Contract

To get started, try editing the`VeBALFeeDiscountHook.sol` contract directly or make a copy

## 4 Deploy a Pool Factory üö¢

Use the `DeployConstantSumFactory` script as a starting point

### üïµÔ∏è 4.1 Examine the Deploy Script

- Deploys a new factory using the `pauseWindowDuration` set in `HelperConfig`
- Deploys mock tokens used for pool initialization and the hooks contract
- Deploys a hooks contract using the `vault` and `router` addresses set in `HelperConfig`

### ü§ñ 4.2 Simulate the Transaction

To simulate sending the transaction to the local anvil fork

```bash
forge script DeployConstantSumFactory --rpc-url localhost
```

To simulate sending the transaction directly to sepolia testnet

```bash
forge script DeployConstantSumFactory --rpc-url sepolia
```

### üì° 4.3 Broadcast the Transaction

To send the deployment transactions to your local anvil fork

```bash
yarn deploy:factory
```

To send the deployment transactions to sepolia testnet

```bash
 yarn deploy:factory ‚Äînetwork sepolia
```

üõà To simulate or deploy to a different network, swap out `sepolia` for any of the `[rpc_endpoints]` aliases listed in `foundry.toml`

## 5 Deploy a Custom Pool ‚õµ

After the factory contract has been deployed, pools can be deployed and registered using the `DeployConstantSumPool1` and `DeployConstantSumPool2` scripts. Both scripts also handle initialization of the pool. Also notice that the [Pools](http://localhost:3000/pools) page will automatically add a button above the search bar for any pools deployed using the latest factory contract

### üïµÔ∏è 5.1 Examine the Deploy Scripts

- `DeployConstantSumPool1` pulls **all** the registration and initialization configurations from `HelperConfig`
  - The default `HelperConfig` does not use a `poolHooksContract`
- `DeployConstantSumPool2` pulls **only some** of the registration and initialization configurations from `HelperConfig`
  - This script uses the most recently deployed `VeBALFeeDiscountHook` during pool registration

### ü§ñ 5.2 Simulate the Transaction

To simulate the pool deployment on your local fork

```bash
forge script DeployConstantSumPool1 --rpc-url localhost
```

### üì° 5.3 Broadcast the Transaction

To send the pool1 deployment transaction to your local fork

```bash
yarn deploy:pool1
```

To send the pool2 deployment transaction to your local fork

```bash
yarn deploy:pool2
```
