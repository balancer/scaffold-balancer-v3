# BAL Hookathon - OrderHoook

## Overview

OrderHook is a custom Balancer V3 hook designed to automate and enhance the management of token swaps in decentralized exchanges. This contract enables users to define conditional orders, such as stop-loss, take-profit, buy-stop and stop-limit orders, directly within a Balancer pool.

The hook is triggered after a swap occurs in the Balancer pool, capturing key data about the transaction (such as token addresses and their current prices). It emits this data as events, which can be processed by off-chain systems or other smart contracts to implement advanced order execution strategies or to notify users about the status of their orders.

## What the Hook Does

OrderHook is triggered after a swap operation in a Balancer pool. It is designed to:

- Emit Events for Post-Swap Processing: The hook captures essential information such as ```tokenIn```, ```tokenOut``` addresses, and their respective amounts swapped. These details are emitted as events, enabling off-chain systems or other smart contracts to react and process the swap results in real-time.

- Price Tracking and Analytics: The hook records the prices of ```tokenIn``` and ```tokenOut``` within the pool at the time of the swap. This data is emitted as part of the events, which can be used for analytics, on-chain reporting or to dynamically adjust strategies based on price movements.

- Support for Advanced Order Types: The hook processes four types of orders—Stop Loss, Buy Stop, Stop Limit and Take Profit. These advanced order types enable users to manage risk and automate trading strategies by executing swaps based on specific price thresholds or market conditions.

- On-Chain Strategy Execution: The hook’s event system can serve as a trigger for executing automated strategies, such as rebalancing portfolios, adjusting liquidity ratios or triggering conditional swaps based on predefined rules.

- Security and Auditing: By emitting detailed swap event data, the hook provides transparency and traceability for each transaction, which can be valuable for audits, risk management and security analysis.

## Example Use Case

Imagine a decentralized trading platform where users can place take-profit orders on token swaps. OrderHook can be integrated into this platform to facilitate order execution as follows:

- A user wants to make a swap that automatically executes when the price of a specific token reaches a certain threshold, allowing them to secure profits.
- The user submits their order to the OrderHook smart contract, specifying the token pair, desired price threshold, and swap parameters.
- When the token price in the Balancer pool meets or exceeds the specified threshold, OrderHook emits an event containing details such as the prices of tokenIn and tokenOut, their corresponding addresses, and the pool address.
- The platform's backend system or any backend service listens for these events and triggers a notification to the user, informing them that their take-profit conditions have been met.
- Based on this event, the trade is automatically executed to swap the tokens, or in case of slippage, the user can be refunded.

## Feedback About Developer Experience (DevX)

Working with the Balancer V3 hook framework has been an exciting experience. The modular design of the system makes it easy to plug in custom logic at various stages of the swap lifecycle. Here are a few insights from the development process:

- Flexibility: The hook architecture offers tremendous flexibility, allowing for custom workflows and integration with other DeFi systems like Uniswap or cross-chain operations.

- Documentation and Tooling: While the overall documentation for Balancer V3 was helpful, more examples and tooling specific to hooks would enhance the developer experience. Offering more templates or pre-built hooks could reduce development time and improve onboarding for new developers.
