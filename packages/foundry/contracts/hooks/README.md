# What the hook does
The MEV Tax Hook allows Balancer pools to capture their own MEV by charging a dynamic fee based on the priority of transactions interacting with them.

It calculates the priority fee, then multiplies this by a configurable tax multiplier to determine the additional fee percentage. This dynamic fee is added to the application's base fee, enabling it to capture a portion of the MEV generated by high-priority transactions.

# Example use case:
When an arbitrage bot detects an opportunity between a Balancer pool and another DEX, it will use a a high-priority transaction to capitalize on the price discrepancy. By implementing the MEV Tax Hook, the bot's transaction would incur a higher fee proportional to its priority. This additional fee would be captured by the pool itself, rather than being entirely extracted by miners or other arbitrageurs, thus aligning incentives and redistributing MEV more equitably among ecosystem participants.

# Feedback about DevX
* Matt's Intro to Scaffold was extremely helpful -- a concise but complete guide to getting started.
* The code surrounding hooks itself is very well commented. I honestly read the comments there long before even opening the hook docs.
