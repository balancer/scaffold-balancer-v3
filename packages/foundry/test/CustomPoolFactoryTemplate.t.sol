/**
 * @title Custom Pool Factory Starter Test Template
 * @author BUIDL GUIDL
 * @notice This test file serves as a starting template that developers can use when creating their own BalancerV3 custom pool factory tests.  Paired with the README, this template has comments marked "TODO" that help guide devlopers to address starting test aspects. This is not production ready, and it is the developers responsibility to carry out proper testing and auditing for their pool.
 * These tests roughly mirror the typical testing cases that are found in the BalancerV3 monorepo for weighted pool factory tests.  As a reference tool, it only makes sense to have tests that, at the very least, roughly mirror how weighted pool factories are tested within BalancerV3 monorepo.
 * @dev This template is written for the Constant Price Custom Pool Factory.
 * When creating your own custom pool factory, developers are expected to: create their own custom pool factory file, test file, script file, and of course update dependencies as needed. They simply can just duplicate or override the files that are in this repo marked as "example" within their title.
